    "This is the fifth exercise and it involves estimating parameters in a multi-variate energy balance model with added empirical elements. The predictions are aligned to the measured values through an optimizer that adjusts the parameters to minimize a sum of squared error or sum of absolute values objective. This lab builds upon the TCLab C by using the estimation of parameters in an energy balance but also adding additional equations that give a 2nd order response. The 2nd order response comes from splitting the finite element model of the heaters and temperature sensors. This creates a total of 4 differential equations with parameters that are adjusted to minimize the difference between the predicted and measured temperatures."
